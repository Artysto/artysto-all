This website in it's current state is a re-implementation of a Bucky Robert's tutorial on Django in Django 2.2.3 and Python 3. Which was originally implemented in Django 1.9.4. The backend is my own implementation that I share with other Django learner's who are stuck with his tutorial when working with newer Django versions. All credit's go to Bucky Roberts as such.
